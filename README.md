# HW03: Multiple Regression Analysis

**Author**: Ellen Hwang

**Project Description and Structure**: This assignment's purpose is to practicing exloratory data analysis using regression functions in R and to familiarize with a reproducible project structure. Makefile to compiles code, graphs, and report. This assignment is divided into code, data, images, and report.

**Steps**:

1. git clone the repository
2. `cd` into directory
3. run `make all` to execute all scripts and get all output
